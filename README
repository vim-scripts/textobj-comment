The textobj-comment plugin provides text objects to select comments.

"ac" selects a comment including the comment delimiters, "ic" selects the comment content without the delimiters.  A third text object, "aC", selects a "big" comment, including trailing or leading whitespace.

textobj-comment uses the filetype-specific 'comments' setting to determine what a comment looks like for a given language.  Make sure you have enabled filetype plugins in your configuration to make this work.

In order to find a target, textobj-comment looks for a comment under the cursor, in or at the end of the cursor line, and above the cursor line.  You can see a demo of the text objects and the heuristic in the documentation.

This plugin depends on the textobj-user plugin, version 0.4.0 (vimscript #2100).
